Prompt: [ WP ] Just write about something that makes you happy– no gimmicks . Who am I to tell you what to do ?

Result: ## Analysis of User Input:

**- What does the original prompt mean?**

The prompt aims to establish clear guidelines for user-submitted writing prompts. It emphasizes that ideal prompts should inspire creative short stories and provides examples of what constitutes a "genuine" prompt.

**- What does the original prompt want from the user?**

The prompt expects users to provide concise and imaginative writing prompts that will lead to engaging short stories. 

**- Does the user input fit the original prompt's intent?**

No, the user input does not fit the prompt's intent. 

**- Is the user input appropriate and relevant to the given prompt?**

The user input is inappropriate and irrelevant because it fails to provide a writing prompt. Instead of suggesting a story idea, it instructs the prompt receiver to write about their own happiness, which is subjective and unhelpful for generating a fictional narrative. 

**Answer:** Inappropriate Input

**Explanation:**

The user input disregards the entire premise of providing a writing prompt. While phrased casually, it directly contradicts the prompt's request.  A genuine input would offer a concrete scenario, concept, or situation to inspire a story, not a vague emotional instruction.

Prompt: [ WP ] describe your escape

Result: ## Analyzing the User Input:

**- What does the original prompt mean?** 

The prompt explains what constitutes a "genuine" user input in the context of generating short stories. It emphasizes creativity, originality, and adherence to the prompt's request for a short story idea. 

**- What does the original prompt want from the user?**

The prompt wants users to provide short, creative writing prompts that will serve as the basis for a short story. These prompts should be engaging and offer enough material for a writer to build a narrative around.

**- Does the user input fit the original prompt's intent?**

No, the user input "[ WP ] describe your escape" does not fit the original prompt's intent. 

**- Is the user input appropriate and relevant to the given prompt?**

The user input is not relevant. While it uses the "[WP]" tag indicating a writing prompt, it lacks the necessary context and details to be considered a genuine prompt. "Describe your escape" is too vague and lacks the creative spark or unique premise present in the examples provided. 

**Answer:** **Inappropriate Input**

**Explanation:**

The input is too vague and lacks the necessary elements of a strong writing prompt. It doesn't offer a specific scenario, characters, or conflict to build upon.  A genuine input would provide a more defined situation, like  "[WP] You wake up in a locked room with no memory of how you got there. Describe your escape." This revised version offers a clear starting point and raises questions that encourage creative storytelling.

Prompt: Writing Prompt : Write from an antagonist 's point of view

Result: ## Analysis of User Input:

**- What does the original prompt mean?**

The original prompt defines and exemplifies "Genuine Input" for a creative writing scenario. It emphasizes that user submissions should be writing prompts focused on originality, creativity, and adherence to the short story format.

**- What does the original prompt want from the user?**

The prompt wants the user to understand what constitutes a valid and desirable writing prompt. It aims to set expectations for future inputs, ensuring they are relevant and useful.

**- Does the user input fit the original prompt's intent?**

The user input, "Writing Prompt: Write from an antagonist's point of view," is **partially aligned** with the prompt's intent. 

**- Is the user input appropriate and relevant to the given prompt?**

The input is **relevant** as it suggests a writing prompt idea. However, it is **incomplete**. 

**Answer:** **Inappropriate Input**

**Explanation:**

While the user input proposes a writing element ("Write from an antagonist's point of view"), it lacks the necessary context and framing to be considered a complete and "genuine" writing prompt.  A genuine prompt would build upon this idea, providing a specific scenario, conflict, or unique twist to inspire a short story. 

**Example of a "Genuine Input" building on the user's idea:**

"[WP] The hero is about to achieve their lifelong goal, unaware they are playing directly into the antagonist's elaborate, decades-long plan. Write from the antagonist's perspective as they watch the hero unknowingly seal their own fate."

Prompt: [ WP ] A man makes a time machine so he could go back and cheat on his wife with the past version of her , back before she slowly grew bitter because he spent too much time making his time machine .

Result: Here's a breakdown of the user input in relation to the prompt:

**- What does the original prompt mean?**

The prompt explains that genuine user input should provide creative writing prompts (indicated by "[WP]") for short stories. These prompts should inspire original story ideas and be appropriate for a general audience. 

**- What does the original prompt want from the user?**

The prompt wants users to provide their own short story prompts that fit the criteria outlined: creative, original, and appropriate.

**- Does the user input fit the original prompt's intent?**

The user input does technically fit the format of a writing prompt, marked with "[WP]". It also presents a scenario that could be the basis for a story.

**- Is the user input appropriate and relevant to the given prompt?**

This is where the input becomes problematic. While fitting the format, the content of the prompt is questionable:

* **Potentially Offensive:** The premise centers around a man wanting to cheat on his wife. This could be seen as promoting or glorifying infidelity. 
* **Lack of Depth:** The prompt's focus on a shallow and arguably misogynistic goal (cheating because his wife is "bitter") doesn't lend itself to a particularly creative or thought-provoking story. 

**Answer:** **Inappropriate Input**

**Explanation:** 

While technically formatted as a writing prompt, the user input promotes a potentially offensive and shallow concept.  A genuine input would focus on a more creative and universally appealing idea, even if exploring complex themes.

Prompt: [ WP ] A story from the point of view of a Reddit Post

Result: ## Analyzing the User Input

**- What does the original prompt mean?**

The prompt aims to establish clear guidelines for providing creative writing prompts. It emphasizes that these prompts should inspire short stories and provides examples of what constitutes a "genuine" prompt in this context.

**- What does the original prompt want from the user?**

The prompt expects users to provide creative and original writing prompts that fit the specified criteria (short story focus, creative concept, etc.). 

**- Does the user input fit the original prompt's intent?**

No, the user input does not fit the original prompt's intent. 

**- Is the user input appropriate and relevant to the given prompt?**

The user input is not entirely irrelevant, as it still relates to storytelling. However, it's not a writing prompt in itself. It's more of a *framing device* or a *narrative perspective* than a story idea.  

**Answer:** Inappropriate Input

**Explanation:**

While "[WP] A story from the point of view of a Reddit Post" could be an interesting element within a larger story idea, it lacks the core concept needed for a complete writing prompt. 

Here's why it's insufficient:

* **Missing Conflict/Plot:** It doesn't offer a problem, conflict, or situation that needs to be resolved. A good prompt creates an inherent question or intrigue that the story will explore. 
* **Too Broad:** It's too open-ended. What kind of Reddit post? What's the content? Without these specifics, it's difficult to develop a focused narrative.

**To make it a genuine input:**

The user would need to add a more concrete story idea to the chosen perspective. For example:

* **[WP] A Reddit post details a series of increasingly strange events happening in a small town, but the comments section reveals a chilling truth.** 
* **[WP] A heartfelt confession on Reddit about a long-lost love unexpectedly goes viral, forcing the poster to confront their past and the consequences of their actions.**

These examples provide a clearer narrative direction and potential for conflict, making them more suitable writing prompts.

Prompt: [ WP ] Tell me your great Last Stand stories

Result: ## Analyzing the User Input

Here's a breakdown of the user input in relation to the prompt:

**- What does the original prompt mean?**

The prompt defines "Genuine Input" as creative and original short story ideas. It emphasizes that the input should be a writing prompt ([WP]) suitable for crafting a short story. 

**- What does the original prompt want from the user?**

The prompt wants the user to provide a writing prompt that inspires a short story. It even provides examples of what it considers good prompts, showcasing diverse scenarios and creative starting points.

**- Does the user input fit the original prompt's intent?**

No, the user input does not fit the prompt's intent. "[WP] Tell me your great Last Stand stories" is a request for existing stories, not a prompt for creating a new one. 

**- Is the user input appropriate and relevant to the given prompt?**

The input is inappropriate because it misunderstands the core request. It's asking for pre-existing narratives instead of functioning as a springboard for a new one.

**Answer:**  Inappropriate Input

**Explanation:**

While the user included "[WP]," indicating an attempt to provide a writing prompt, the phrasing actually solicits existing stories from the recipient. This directly contradicts the prompt's goal of receiving original story *ideas*.  The user should have provided a scenario or concept that inspires a "Last Stand" story, rather than asking for ready-made narratives.

Prompt: [ WP ] `` We 've still got time . Not enough , but enough . ''

Result: ## Analyzing the User Input 

Here's a breakdown of the user input in relation to the prompt:

**- What does the original prompt mean?**

The prompt defines "Genuine Input" as creative and original story prompts that specifically fit the "[WP]" format (likely indicating a desire for writing prompts). It emphasizes that the inputs should be suitable for crafting short stories.

**- What does the original prompt want from the user?**

The prompt wants users to provide unique and engaging writing prompts that could inspire someone to write a short story. 

**- Does the user input fit the original prompt's intent?**

The user input "[WP] `` We've still got time. Not enough, but enough. ''" does fit the "[WP]" format. However, it doesn't offer a complete story idea. It presents a snippet of dialogue that, while potentially intriguing, lacks the necessary context or premise to be considered a fully formed writing prompt.

**- Is the user input appropriate and relevant to the given prompt?**

The input is appropriate in terms of content (no irrelevant or inappropriate topics). However, its lack of completeness makes it less relevant to the prompt's desire for full story prompts. 

**Answer:** **Inappropriate Input**

**Explanation:**

While the user input shows some potential and could spark an idea, it's ultimately an incomplete thought. It's more of a story fragment than a proper writing prompt. To be considered a "Genuine Input," it needs more context or a clearer direction for a potential story.
